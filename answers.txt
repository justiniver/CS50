sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: The time significantly improved after running the program through the pre-sorted sorted50000.txt file.
Bubble sort is the only sorting method where its lowerbound is different than its upperbound.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: I ran this file through random50000.txt and this sorting program outperformed the others.
When running this file through sorted50000.txt the time didn't improve which furthers my claims due to merge sort having the same upperbound and lowerbound.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Running this file through the sorted numbers vs random similar results were found.
This file also takes more time than sort2 (merge sort) which means it is either bubble sort or selection sort.
